# Synergy
Junction 2017 platform

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/hackjunction/Synergy.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hackjunction/Synergy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hackjunction/Synergy)

## Development

1. Install *yarn* by running
```
npm install -g yarn
```

2. Install dependencies by running (run always when `yarn.lock` file has changed when you pull)
```
yarn
```

3. Add `.env` to get your local configuration in place (Ask for the keys). *Use `src/lib/config.js` to import configuration to other script files!*

4. Launch the internal server
```
yarn start
```
and
```
yarn watch
```
And it should be running on localhost:3000


## Additional scripts

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start` and `yarn watch`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`npm run or yarn <script>`|Description|
|--------------------------|-----------|
|`start`|Run your app in development mode if NODE_ENV is development or else in production.|
|`watch`|Run your app in development mode and watch your changes.|
|`start:dev`|Run your app in development mode.|
|`start:prod`|Run your app in production mode.|
|`build:webpack"`|Compiles the application to the build folder in productiopn mode.|
|`lint`|Check for lint errors and runs the fixes for all `.js`, `.jsx` and `.json` files.|

## Troubleshooting

If your wordpress doesn't display json add `?rest_route=/wp/v2/posts` at the end of your url
Change the permalink setting in the wp-admin to something like Post name and it should now work.
