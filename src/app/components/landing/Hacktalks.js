            <p>
              Junction is a converging point thousands of developers, designers,
            and entrepreneurs from around the world. In 2016, Junction provided
            the biggest hackathon experience in Europe by bringing together 1300
            participants from over 70 countries.
          </p>
            <p>
              Hackathons are all about taking something you love, combining it
            with tech and learning something in the process. Junction brings
            together hackers, designers, the coolest partners and hardware for
            one weekend of hacking.
          </p>
            <p>
              Junction is not your standard cafeteria hackathon. Junction is meant
            to be seen, to be heard, to be felt and most importantly to be
            experienced. Held annually in the cold and slushy Helsinki of late
            November, Junction is bound to be an unforgettable experience.
            Junction is the place to design and develop your ideas into actual
            projects together with like-minded hackers.

              If you don’t yet have a team we will also help with matching people up at

              channels to make the team-building easier already before the event. If you
              have been accepted, you should have an invitation in your email for joining
              the Facebook group. A slack invite is incoming also!

            <p>
              You can work on multiple tracks at the same time, but it’s best if you could
              focus on one or two. Tracks are in situated in interconnected rooms: Think of it
              as a minihackathon within that theme, but the benefits of connecting to a huge
              pool of participants and activities.
