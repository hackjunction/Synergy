            <p>
              Junction is a converging point thousands of developers, designers, and entrepreneurs from around the
              world. In 2016, Junction provided the biggest hackathon experience in Europe by bringing together 1300
              participants from over 70 countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hackathons are all about taking something you love, combining it with tech and learning something in the
              process. Junction brings together hackers, designers, the coolest partners and hardware for one weekend of
              hacking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Junction is not your standard cafeteria hackathon. Junction is meant to be seen, to be heard, to be felt
              and most importantly to be experienced. Held annually in the cold and slushy Helsinki of late November,
              Junction is bound to be an unforgettable experience. Junction is the place to design and develop your
              ideas into actual projects together with like-minded hackers.
