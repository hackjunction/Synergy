          <h4>A COMMUNITY OF CREATORS</h4>
          <p>
            Junction has grown to become Europe’s biggest hackathon and an embodiment of the blooming startup ecosystem
            of the Nordics. But that’s not all we are about. We know that the future is not created by individuals, it’s
            created by communities, ideologies, and beliefs. That’s why Junction is much more than an event, it is an
            ideology, a movement with the goal of inspiring and fostering a community of creators. At Junction we
            believe a fun open-minded environment, innovative industry partners, and a little bit of passion is the
            beginning to creating a better tomorrow.

          <h4>JUNCTION – 48 HOURS TO BUILD THE FUTURE</h4>
          <p>
            Hackathons are all about taking something you love, combining it with tech and learning something in the
            process. Junction brings together hackers, designers, the coolest partners and hardware for one weekend of
            hacking. It’s a place where creators can let go of their inhibitions and create cool inspiring projects.

          <h4>UNIQUE FROM THE GROUND UP</h4>
          <p>
            Junction is not your standard cafeteria hackathon. Junction is meant to be seen, to be heard, to be felt and
            most importantly to be experienced. Held annually in the cold and slushy Helsinki of late November, Junction
            is bound to be an unforgettable experience. In 2015 Junction was built inside of an old abandoned boiler
            hall. In 2016 we took over a19th century shipping warehouse right next to the sea. This year we are bringing
            Junction 2017 to the roots of it all: overtaking the newly renovated main building of Aalto University,
            Dipoli, to shine light to the importance of our mission of inspiring people to learn and create with
            technology.
