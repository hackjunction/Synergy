          Junction is meant to be seen, heard and most importantly felt. This year, we‚Äôre taking Junction back to its
          roots to Espoo and creating a new world of hackathons inside Aalto University‚Äôs newly renovated main building,
          Dipoli. Like the years before, our unique venue designs guarantee an extraordinary experience for everyone
          stepping inside Junction.
