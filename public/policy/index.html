  <p>
    We collect two types of information from the Users: User Data and Analytics Data. Although we do not normally use Analytics Data to identify individuals, sometimes individuals can be recognized from it, either alone or when combined or linked with User Data. In such situations, Analytics Data can also be considered to be personal data under applicable laws and we will treat the combined data as personal data.

  <h2>
    3. PURPOSES AND LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
  </h2>
  <h3>
    Purposes
  </h3>

  <h2>
    There are several purposes for the processing of personal data by the Company:
  </h2>

  <h4>
    To provide and develop the Services and to organize and develop the Events
  </h4>
  <p>
 We process personal data in the first place to be able to offer the Services to the Users, to organize the Events as well as for User verification. We process personal data for the evaluation and selection of potential applicants and team members for the Events.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also process the personal data provided by the Users in order to develop the quality of our Services and Events, for instance by analyzing the employment histories of the Users and the programs the Users have applied to.
  </p>

  <h4>
    For customer communication and marketing
  </h4>
  <p>
    We process personal data for the purpose of maintaining our customer relationships with the Users, for instance by contacting the Users regarding the Services and Events. We also process personal data of the Users in order to inform the Users of changes relating to the Services and the Events. We use personal data for marketing and advertising the services and products provided by us, e.g. to customize the User’s experience by providing the User with targeted offers and advertising information based on the information gathered from the User during his/her previous visits to the Services and to the Events.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the User contacts us to give feedback with respect to our Services or Events, we will use the provided information for answering questions and solving possible issues.
  </p>

  <h4>
    For the recruitment and headhunting purposes
  </h4>

  <p>
    We process User Data for the purpose of providing such data to our Recruitment Partners (as defined below) for recruitment and headhunting purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Legitimate grounds for processing
  </h3>
  <p>
    We process personal data to perform our contractual obligations towards the Users with respect to the Users registered on our Websites and Users having applied or registered as participants or attendees in the Events. Furthermore, we process personal data based on our legitimate interest. Our legitimate interest is based on running, maintaining and developing our business, improving the customer or visitor experience of the Users as well as on performing direct marketing. When choosing to use your data on the basis of our legitimate interests, we weigh our own interests against your right to privacy and e.g. provide you with easy to use opt-out from our marketing communications and use pseudonymized or non-personally identifiable data when possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some parts of the Services, the Users may be requested to grant their consent for the processing of personal data. In this event, Users may withdraw their consent at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>
    4. TRANSFERS TO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Company stores the Users’ personal data primarily within the European Economic Area. However we have service providers in several geographical locations.  As such, we, and our service providers may transfer personal data to, or access it in, jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area or the User’s domicile.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will take steps to ensure that the Users’ personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which it is processed. We provide adequate protection for the transfers of personal data to countries outside of the European Economic Area through a series of agreements with our service providersbased on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">Standard Contractual Clauses</a> or through other appropriate safeguards, such as the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome">Privacy Shield Framework</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    More information regarding the transfers of personal data may be obtained by contacting us on address mentioned in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>
    5. RECIPIENTS
  </h2>
  <p>
    We only share personal data within the Junction organisation if and as far as reasonably necessary to perform and develop our Services and the arrangements relating to the organization of the Events. We do not share personal data with third parties outside of Junction organization unless one of the following circumstances applies:
  </p>
  <h4>
    For legal reasons
  </h4>

When possible, we will inform the Users about such transfer and processing.
  </p>
  <h4>
    To authorized service providers
  </h4>
  <p>
    We may share personal data to authorized service providers who perform services for us (including data storage, sales, marketing and customer support services).

  </h4>

  </p>
  <p>
    The User has the right to withdraw the above mentioned consents at all times.
